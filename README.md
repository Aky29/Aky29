# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on hands-on data science projects like house price prediction, sentiment analysis, and building clean, reproducible pipelines with SQL and Python.<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on learning groups, project teams, and GitHub repo challenges for analytics and end-to-end machine learning workflows.<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with advanced data cleaning techniques, practical feature engineering, and best practices for model validation and metrics.<br>🌱 I’m currently learning statistics for machine learning, visualization tools, and cross-platform reporting for impactful data stories.<br>💬 Ask me about quick SQL-Python data wrangling tricks, starting your first ML model, or how to pick projects that boost your portfolio.<br>⚡ Fun fact: I love transforming raw datasets into stories—my favorite part is when real-world messy data turns into clear insights with a few precise lines of code!
